# guess-the-number
I created a "Guess the Number" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It includes features like feedback on each guess (whether the guess is too high or too low), a counter for the number of attempts, and an option to start a new game.
